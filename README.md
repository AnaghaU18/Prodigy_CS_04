# Prodigy_Infotech_Task-04
## Simple Keylogger Project
### Overview
This project is a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the `pynput` library. It captures keystrokes and logs them to a file. The keylogger can be stopped by typing the word "stop" or by pressing the `Esc` key. This project is intended for educational purposes only. Please use it responsibly and ensure you have permission before deploying it.

### Features
- Logs keystrokes to a text file.
- Adds a delimiter and timestamp to separate different keylogger sessions.
- Can be stopped by typing "stop" or pressing the `Esc` key.

### Requirement
- `pynput` library

### Installation
1. Clone the Repository:

  ```sh
  
  ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the Keylogger:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Start typing (For example: Type in a notepad)
3. Stop the keylooger by typing "stop". The program is not case sensitive. (Note: If typing on bash/shell, press `Esc` on the keyboard after this step.)
4. View Logs by opening the `keylog.txt` file. Each session will be separated by a delimiter and timestamp.

## Ethical Considerations
